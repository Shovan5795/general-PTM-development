"In addition, highly MODIFIED forms of E6-AP cannot bind to p53 in the presence of the E6 oncoprotein and, conversely, binding of E6-AP to p53 interferes with MODIFICATION of [E]PROTEIN[/E]",1
The TRANSFERASE associates specifically with phosphorylated destruction motifs in IkappaBalpha and beta-catenin and stimulates [E]PROTEIN[/E] MODIFICATION in vitro,1
"In addition, the results support a model for TRANSFERASE function in which the amino-terminal domain mediates substrate binding, while the carboxyl-terminal hect domain catalyzes MODIFICATION of [E]PROTEIN[/E].",1
"When mixed together, SCFCdc4p subunits, E1 enzyme, the TRANSFERASE enzyme Cdc34p, and GROUP are sufficient to reconstitute MODIFICATION of [E]PROTEIN[/E]",1
"A complex of Cdc4p, Skp1p, and Cdc53p/cullin catalyzes MODIFICATION of [E]PROTEIN[/E]",1
